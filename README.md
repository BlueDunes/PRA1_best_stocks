# PRA1_best_stocks

## Description
This project was created as part of the course "Tipologia i cicle de vida de les dades" (Master's Degree in Data Science - Universitat Oberta de Catalunya).
The objective is to figure out which are the bests stocks according to the best fund managers. 
In order to achieve that objective, we extract first a list of the funds with the highest 10-year returns. Then, we select the ones that had a higher return than the NASDAQ and collect a list of the main stocks they invest in. We finally collect some of the main parameters related to each stock and generate a dataframe with the information.
